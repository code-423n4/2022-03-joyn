Heads up to anyone who's looking at the `RoyaltyVaultFactory`, it's out of scope and the `SplitFactory` is pulling double duty to deploy `ProxyVaults` as well as `SplitProxies`.

Ideally any test contracts would be clearly marked as so as it's not too much of a leap to assume that a `RoyaltyVaultFactory` would be responsible for the production deployments of the `RoyaltyVault` contracts.

That's correct, thank you! We should have been more clear about that, sorry for the confusion. The RoyaltyVaultFactory is indeed a contract used for testing 🙂

MultiSigWallet is out of scope right?

Yes, it is out of scope

is there a workaround for this? It happens during 'npm install' in two of the three folders:
> npm ERR! Error while executing:
> npm ERR! /usr/bin/git ls-remote -h -t ssh://git@github.com/ChestrNFT/royalty-vault.git
> npm ERR! 
> npm ERR! git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
> npm ERR! fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
